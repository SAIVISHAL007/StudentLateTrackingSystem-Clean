# Quick Reference Guide for Faculty Approach

## VERSION 1: Email Subject & Body (Initial Contact)

**Subject:** Request for Guidance - Student Late Tracking System Project

Dear Ma'am/Sir,

I am [Your Name] from [Year & Branch]. I have an idea to help reduce the paperwork involved in recording late-coming students during the first hour.

Currently, faculty members write student details on paper sheets. I propose developing a simple web application where you can quickly enter student details digitally. The system will automatically track repeat late-comers and generate reports when needed.

This will save time, eliminate paperwork, and make it easier to monitor student attendance patterns.

I would be grateful if you could spare 10-15 minutes to discuss this idea and guide me in developing a system that truly helps faculty members.

Please let me know a convenient time to meet.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[Roll No]

## VERSION 2: Verbal Pitch (30 seconds)

"Good morning Ma'am/Sir,

I'm [Your Name] from [Year-Branch]. I've noticed that marking late students on paper during first hour takes time and creates storage issues.

I want to build a web application where you can simply type the roll number, and everything else - student details, total late days, history - gets recorded and tracked automatically.

No more paper registers. Everything digital, searchable, and always accessible.

Could I get 10 minutes of your time to explain the idea and get your guidance on making it useful for faculty?"

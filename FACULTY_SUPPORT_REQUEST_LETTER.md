**Subject: Request for Guidance - Student Late Monitoring Web Application**

Respected Madam,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to present an idea regarding improvement of the current late attendance recording process in our college.

Currently, student late arrivals during first hour are recorded manually on paper sheets. I propose a web-based application that allows faculty to enter late student details digitally, helping maintain structured records, track attendance patterns, reduce paperwork, and improve monitoring efficiency.

I have developed an initial prototype using MERN Stack technology. However, I require your valuable guidance to refine the system design, improve functionality, and align it with institutional requirements.

I kindly request your support and mentorship to develop this into an efficient system that could benefit our department and institution.

I would be grateful for an opportunity to discuss this with you at your convenience.

Thanking you.

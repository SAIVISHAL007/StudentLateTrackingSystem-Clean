##  Overview

The **Student Late Tracking System** is a modern, enterprise-grade solution designed to digitize and automate attendance management for educational institutions. Built with the MERN stack and deployed on Vercel with MongoDB Atlas, this system handles real-time attendance tracking, automated fine calculations, role-based access control, comprehensive analytics, and provides secure, scalable infrastructure for multiple user roles.

###  Problem Statement
Traditional manual attendance tracking systems are:
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack real-time insights and analytics
- Difficult to maintain historical records
- Have no automated fine calculation or semester management
- Lack proper role-based access control
- Cannot handle bulk operations efficiently

###  Solution Delivered
This system provides:
- **Instant attendance recording** with instant fine calculation
- **Automated fine calculation** with configurable progressive rates
- **Real-time analytics dashboard** with visual insights and leaderboards
- **Robust role-based access control** (Faculty, Admin, SuperAdmin)
- **Offline-first architecture** with service worker support and automatic sync
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for accountability and compliance
- **Bulk operations** for semester promotions and record management
- **Professional UI** with responsive design and modern glassmorphism effects
